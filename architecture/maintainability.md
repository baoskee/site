# Maintainability

## Context

The ongoing maintenance of a system costs more that the initial development.
It's not surprising that more people are hired for maintaining a legacy system, instead of building from scratch.

Improving the maintainability of a system reduces the cost and hence it's an over-going thing that most companies are thriving to achieve.

## Overview

The maintainability of a system has not a concrete measurement like [availability](/availability.html). However, it relates to several factors:

* How fast a but fix can be checked in and released;
* The number of operation engineers;
* The mean time to detect and resolve incidents;
* The number of security vulnerables by regularly security scanning and auditing;
* The size of the pool of tech debts;
* The size of the pool of new requirements;
* The number of you getting On-Call requests. ðŸ“ž
* ...

Most factors can be categorized into three:

* The evolvability of the code.
* The operability of the system.
* The simplicity of the code and system.

## Conclusions

There is no easy way to measure the maintainability of a system, though we can take a lot of actions to make it simpler, make the life of operations easier, and make it easier to extend and grow.
