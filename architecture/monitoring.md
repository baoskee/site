# Monitoring

Monitoring is the action of observing and checking the behavior and outputs of the system and its components over time.

## Essential Concepts

### Time Series

A time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order.
Each data point is often a numeric value.
Each time series consists of a name plus optional tags.

Check [Time Series](time-series.md).

### Metrics

Metrics represent the raw measurements of resource usage or behavior that can be observed and collected throughout your systems.

### Logs

### Alerts
